I have worked extensively on the Laravel framework, which is well-suited for building robust and scalable web applications. My current project uses Laravel Framework 9.x, leveraging its features like  middleware, and Sanctum for API authentication.
1. Clone the repository.
2. Switch to the 'dev' branch: git checkout dev" 
3. Run 'composer install' to install dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file and configure it.
4. Generate the application key:php artisan key:generate
5. Run 'php artisan migrate' to set up the database.
6. git checkout dev
7. composer install
8. php artisan key:generate
9. php artisan migrate
10. php artisan serve
